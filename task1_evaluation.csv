How is a rotator cuff tear repaired?,"A rotator cuff tear is repaired through a multi-step procedure (medical records).

The repair involves:
*   Debridement of the articular side of the rotator cuff and subchondral debridement to the tuberosity (medical records).

Describe the procedure for a tonsillectomy.,"The tonsillectomy procedure involves several steps. The right tonsil is grasped with a tenaculum and retracted from its fossa (medical records). The anterior tonsillar pillar is incised with a #12 knife blade, and the plica semilunaris is incised with Metzenbaum scissors (medical records). The tonsil is then dissected free of its fossa onto an inferior pedicle using Metzenbaum scissors and a Fisher knife (medical records). A tonsillar snare is placed and applied around the pedicle, and the tonsil is removed from the fossa (medical records). Alternatively, the plane between the tonsil and musculature is developed, and the tonsil is completely dissected out, preserving both the anterior and posterior tonsillar pillars (medical records).

After removal, the fossa is packed with a cherry gauze sponge (medical records). A similar procedure is then performed for the opposite tonsil, and its fossa is also packed (medical records).

Attention is then re-directed to the right tonsil, where the pack is removed and bleeding is controlled with a suction Bovie unit (medical records). Bleeding is similarly controlled in the left tonsillar fossa and the nasopharynx after pack removal (medical records). All bleeders encountered during dissection are cauterized, and both tonsil beds are re-cauterized, with particular attention to the inferior and superior poles (medical records). Finally, catheters are removed, and the nasal passages and oropharynx are suctioned (medical records). The stomach is evacuated with a nasogastric tube (medical records). The patient is then awakened, extubated, and taken to the recovery room (medical records)."," Bilateral Myringotomies - 1 ,  Tonsillectomy "
